        <p>
            I am a born and raised native of Newington, CT.   My genetic makeup is of Irish, African American and 
Native American decent.  I graduated from Newington High School and later went on to teach there.  I 
never knew that I would teach at the very school where I experienced so much joy.   I was saddened 
when my teaching experience was overshadowed by racism, the exact opposite of my expectations, first 
hand.  We all know the American dark secret exists but when you’re on the receiving end, it leaves a scar
forever.  I have made it my business to combat racial intolerance through activism.  I am a leader in the 
Black Live Matter movement.  I have brought many people together of all races.  I co-founded the Ally 
Collective and CT Peace Festival.  I was excited when the team at Silver City Uprising asked me to apply 
for the chair position.
I graduated from Central University, Summa Cum Laude.  I received the Highest Achievement award in 
Foreign Language, Latin.  My honor societies include: The English Honor Society, Sigma Tau Delta, 
Professional Honor Society, and Alpha Lambda Delta. In light of all those achievements there is nothing 
like being on the front lines for the economic empowerment of the black community.  I stand strong in 
those beliefs and refuse to be silenced.  Every black life matter and until those words are unuttered in 
the police department, schools and legislation takes action on our behalf, I will always be on that 
battlefield.
I valued working as a student worker for Veteran Affairs Helping student veterans, assisting with 
certifications for enrollment, helping with homework or other responsibilities.  As  student worker my 
most exciting experience was with the Veterans History Project where I	Interviewed veterans in their 
homes, collecting/organizing photographs or pertinent documents, uploading and maintaining website 
profiles of veterans, answering phones, working with faculty and various personnel, working with digital 
tools, digitally formatting projects, organized historical trip to Gettysburg, PA.
 I now look forward to contributing to the success of Silver City Uprising.

        <p> resides in Meriden, CT and I have been married for 27 years with 2 children ages 19 and 
            14. 
            A Georgia native, moved to Meriden when she was 2 years old. I was educated by the Meriden public 
            schools and graduated from Platt High School in 1990. I received my Bachelors of Science for Human 
            Services in 2016 from Springfield College. I plan on pursuing my Master's Degree in the near future. 
             I got married in 1993 to my High School sweetheart & he also received his education from the Meriden 
            public school system. 
             My love for 	children has	 led me from working at a daycare to working at my current job, which is The 
            Department of Children's and Families, for over 13 years. 
            Growing up in Meriden and deciding to become a homeowner at age 23 in the same town I grew up in 
            and to raise my family here had a lot to do with my relationship with my own family and the love and 
            potential I saw in my city.  My family is a very close-knit family and we see each other often at family 
            events and holidays. My parents and my 4 siblings still reside in Meriden, CT.  
             I have seen Meriden transform over the years into what it is today. We now have a Meriden Green, 
            where things for the community can take place. I like to take walks at the Meriden Linear Trail & The 
            Quinnipiac Trail of Meriden. I also like to visit Hubbard Park and Castle Craig at times. I love talking with 
            people in the community. I help my church with providing donations to the Salvation Army and the 
            homeless shelter during the winter. I love helping people in any way I can. In doing that and in my line of 
            work I see a need to help the underprivileged community and minorities that live in this town. Resources
            don't seem to be readily available to them. 
             Knowledge is power and I am all about the empowerment of the people and the community that we live
            A activities for our youth to participate in, at a fair cost to the people in the community seem hard to 
            find. We don't want their attention to be drawn to other things. We want to help the people in our 
            community become productive members of society to succeed at whatever it is they would like to do in 
            life.  
            I think Silver City Uprising encompasses this and much more! This is why I chose to be a part of this 
            organization.  </p>
